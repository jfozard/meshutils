Tools for working with three-dimensional triangulated meshes in Python

Currently just considers triangulated surfaces.

- Import and export of PLY meshes in ASCII format
- Calculation of surface normals
- Generating vertex and element arrays for visualization (e.g. OpenGL)
- Subdivision and refinement of meshes
